# FitnessGuard

With this german Web-App it is possible to save your runs with distance, time and Maps-Link (e.g. Google Maps). Different tracks can be saved as well. (At the moment they are redundant to the links that are saved with the runs).

This is a work in progress!


More documentation to be added soon.
